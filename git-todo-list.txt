2. generate ssh keys via putty

3. typical git sequence
	
	# If project does not exist in your directory, then clone repo
	git clone <ssh link>

	# Checkout a new branch, by convention, name the branch related to a feature that you're adding
	git branch -b <branch name>

	# when making changes to code/file, all changes made will be marked on git
	# after making changes do the command:
	git status

	# additionally, we need to add changes to the repo
	git add <file name>

		# alternatively, we can add everything from our current repo, but this is a lazy way of doing things
		git add .

	# we need to 'commit' our changes to finalize our actions
	git commit -m "brief descriptive msg"

	# final step to push onto branch, the '-u' stands for 'set upstream'
	git push -u origin <branch name>

	# you can go visit the url and create a pull request
